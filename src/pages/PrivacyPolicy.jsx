Personal details (name, job title, organisation and email) when you sign up to our newsletter and / or events.

Marketing does not just mean offering things for sale, but also includes news and information about:

Demos will ask for individuals to “opt-in” for most communications. This includes all our marketing communications (the term marketing is broadly defined and covers information shared in our newsletter.)

We use personal data to communicate with people, to promote Demos and to help with fundraising activities. This includes keeping you up to date with information from Demos on our research, events, news, job opportunities and other information relating to our work.

When you receive a communication, we may collect information about how you respond to or interact with that communication, and this may affect how we communicate with you in future.

Helping us respect your choices and preferences (e.g. if you ask not to receive marketing material, we’ll keep a record of this).

Sensitive personal data

We do not normally collect or store sensitive personal data (such as information relating to health, beliefs or political affiliation) about those signed up to Demos’s newsletter. However there are some situations where this will occur (e.g. if you have an accident on one of our events). If this does occur, we’ll take extra care to ensure your privacy rights are protected.

Accidents or incidents

If an accident or incident occurs on our property, at one of our events or involving one of our staff then we’ll keep a record of this (which may include personal data and sensitive personal data).

Protect your vital interests;
For our own (or a third party’s) lawful interests, provided your rights don’t override these.
In any event, we’ll only use your information for the purpose or purposes it was collected for (or else for closely related purposes).

Disclosing and sharing data 

Your personal data – which may include your name, organisation, position, and email address are held by our mailing list provider. By signing up to our newsletter you are agreeing to the terms and conditions of MailChimp.com (http://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/). This information is not shared with any other organisation. If you wish to unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time, you can do so by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link, found at the bottom of any email we send you – or by sending your name and email address to hello@demos.co.uk – stating ‘Unsubscribe’ in the email in the subject line or body of the email.

Occasionally, where we partner with other organisations, we may also share information with them (for example, if you register to attend an event being jointly organised by us and another organisation). We’ll only share information when necessary and we will never share your contact information (e.g. email or telephone).

HOW WE PROTECT DATA
We employ a variety of physical and technical measures to keep your data safe and to prevent unauthorised access to, or use or disclosure of your personal information.

Electronic data and databases are stored on secure computer systems and we control who has access to information (using both physical and electronic means). Our staff receive data protection training and we have a set of detailed data protection procedures which personnel are required to follow when handling personal data.

Payment security

All electronic Demos forms that request financial data use pass your details to our payment provider (Stripe Payments Europe: https://stripe.com/gb/privacy; https://stripe.com/privacy-shield-policy). Demos will never store card details and uses Stripe card services which comply with the payment card industry data security standard (PCI-DSS) published by the PCI Security Standards Council, and will never store card details.

Of course, we cannot guarantee the security of your home computer or the internet, and any online communications (e.g. information provided by email or our website) are at the user’s own risk.

STORAGE
Demos stores all personal data safely and securely, and retains information for only as long as is deemed necessary for the purpose. For example, if you ask us not to send you marketing emails, we will stop storing your emails for marketing purposes (though we’ll keep a record of your preference not to be emailed).

We continually review what information we hold and delete what is no longer required. We never store payment card information.

KEEPING YOU IN CONTROL
We want to ensure you remain in control of your personal data. Part of this is making sure you understand your legal rights, which are as follows:

The right to confirmation as to whether or not we have your personal data and, if we do, to obtain a copy of the personal information we hold (this is known as subject access request);
The right to have your data erased (though this will not apply where it is necessary for us to continue to use the data for a lawful reason);
The right to have inaccurate data rectified;
The right to object to your data being used for marketing or profiling; and
Where technically feasible, you have the right to personal data you have provided to us which we process automatically on the basis of your consent or the performance of a contract. This information will be provided in a common electronic format.
Please keep in mind that there are exceptions to the rights above and, though we will always try to respond to your satisfaction, there may be situations where we are unable to do so.

If you would like further information on your rights or wish to exercise them, please write to Demos’ Head of Operations, 15 Whitehall, London, SW1A 2DD or by email; hello@demos.co.uk

You can complain to Demos directly by contacting our Head of Operations using the details set out above.

NOTE ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION AS PERTAINING TO USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA DATA WITHIN DEMOS PROJECTS
The Centre for the Analysis of Social Media (CASM) often conducts research which involves the collection and analysis of publicly available data from social media platforms.  Much of this data, including usernames, is considered personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In order to ensure this data is processed lawfully and transparently, the following procedures are followed by CASM projects undertaken by Demos:

All data collected from social media platforms is accessed through the official application programming interface (API) of that platform, where an API exists, and stored and used in compliance with the platform’s terms of service.
Data is only collected from platforms for which users have provided clear consent, as defined in Article 4(11) of the GDPR, to provide that platform with published data
CASM often applies techniques in artificial intelligence to social media data, in order to conduct research on this data. As we have throughout our history as a research centre, we ensure that the reasons for applying these techniques, the methodology used to analyse data, and the conclusions drawn from our analysis are presented clearly and fully in each report. This includes publishing detailed accuracy scores for any machine learning algorithms applied as part of the research.
This data is securely stored on a monitored server, accessible only to CASM staff, and encrypted in transit. In the event that a data breach is discovered, CASM will act swiftly to ensure that damage from this breach is minimised, including informing relevant supervisory authorities and acting to identify and resolve any security issues allowing the breach.
Data collected from social media sites is not stored for longer than is necessary to complete each project
In order to respect the rights of data controllers to maintain control of their personal data, CASM will remove from any dataset personal data pertaining to an individual who requests such deletion. This includes taking reasonable measures to ensure that content deleted from social media platforms is also removed from datasets used by CASM.</p>
